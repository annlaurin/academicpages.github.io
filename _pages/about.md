I am a psycholinguist trying to discover the mechanisms people use to understand language, anything we hear or read. I am mostly interested in the shortcuts we use -- when a sentence seems to make sense on the surface, sometimes we do not dig too deep and decide that we understand everything prefectly. Some errors and slips of the tongue are really difficult to notice, they seem absolutely fine, while the others jump out at you. 
What I do as a PhD student at the Vasishth lab is exploring how and why, and under which circumstances, we switch superficial language processing on and off.
